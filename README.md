You can easily see the preview of your desired word (and then export the files and print them in the nearset 3D printer)
by following these steps:

1. Enter the Rhino software.
2. In the command line, insert the command ("EditPythonScript").
3. Copy paste the code in the "final_importer.py" (you can find it here in the main branch) and run it.
4. In the command line, enter your desired word (for space use the "_" char).
5. Choose the folder with the letters files (you can find it here in the main branch as "final letters").
6. Enjoy the preview! you can change the sun\camera\view settings in the final_importer scripts (they are currently constants).
7. Export the file from Rhino and print it in your local 3D printer!

Or watching the "how to run the script" video in the main branch.

Enjoy!
